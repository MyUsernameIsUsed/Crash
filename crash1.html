		<h3>After presenting Way of the Warrior to Mark Cerny of Universal Interactive, Naughty Dog was signed on to the company for three additional games.[3] In August 1994, Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin began their move from Boston, Massachusetts to Los Angeles, California.[4] During the trip, Gavin and Rubin decided to create a 3D action-platform game, taking inspiration from 16-bit-era games such as Donkey Kong Country, Mario and Sonic.[5] Because the player would be forced to constantly look at the character's backside, the game was jokingly code-named "Sonic's Ass Game".[3] The basic technology for the game and the Crash Bandicoot series as a whole was created somewhere near Gary, Indiana. The rough game theory was designed near Colorado, Indiana. Soon afterward, Gavin and Rubin discarded their previous game design for Al O. Saurus and Dinestein, a side-scrolling video game based on time travel and scientists genetically merged with dinosaurs.[4] After moving into the Universal Interactive backlot, Gavin and Rubin met with Mark Cerny, discussed the design of the game and made an agreement to go into production.[3] In September 1994, Gavin and Rubin decided to develop their new game for the PlayStation, after which Rubin began character design.[4] In November 1994, Naughty Dog hired Dave Baggett, their first employee and a friend of Gavin's from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[3][4] Together, Gavin and Baggett created the development tool "Game Oriented Object LISP" (GOOL), which would be used to create the characters and gameplay of the game.[3] In January 1995, Rubin became concerned about the programmer-to-artist ratio and hired Bob Rafei and Taylor Kurosaki as additional artists.[3][4]</h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
